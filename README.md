## Departing Windows SysAdmin

A collection of scripts to run on Windows servers when one of your colleagues departs from the unit. 

These scripts are designed to help you identify issues that might arise after they are gone. 

The file server script will report shares setup on a system. Along with the share and ACL permissions. 

The general server script, pulls processes, services, and scheduled tasks and reports on their configurations. You wouldn't want a production scheduled task running under an account you're going to disable in a few weeks.
